"Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?"

I am interested in taking CMSC320 because I haven't touched SQL and my knowledge
on databases is nonexistent. So it would be nice to be able to learn how to use
certain databases and have the ability to manipulate them. It is also great 
practice for me to learn python which I am trying to get better at.
